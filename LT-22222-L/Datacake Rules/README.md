    <h1>Datacake Battery / Temperature /Humidity Rules for Hardware Safety</h1><br>
    <h3>Highly Reccomended <i>Feel free to edit integers to your discretion.</i></h3>
    <p>These rules will instruct your LT to power down your miner and router due
to low battery or high temp/humidity, as well as turn them back on when it
is safe to do so. The LT can operate on as ittle as 7 volts, which will keep
you in control of your hardware even if the voltage is too low to power the
12v solar controller. This will prevent your miner/router from repeatedly
killing the battery in low solar environments, potentially damaging your
battery, or costing you expensive hardware failure due to heat or moisture.</p>

    <h4>That’s it. Hopefully that saves you a lot of stress, a little headache, and a ton of
money. There are endless combinations of sensors and rules you could come up with, be clever. The
more sensors the better. Water detection sensor, door open/close sensor, etc…
